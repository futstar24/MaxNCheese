Max did a fantastic job taking pics of my staff as headshots. He brought lighting and a pro camera and an easy going attitude. The pics came out great. We already booked our next session!

Max was very professional and knowledgeable. He was very helpful in recommending outfits and colors. The pictures came out beautiful. But more importantly he made my daughters feel comfortable and was able to capture their personalities.

I loved getting headshots by Max N Cheese photography!! I wanted headshots for other theater auditions because I didn’t have good photos of me to show. So headshots by Max was cheaper then getting a fancy professional that edits you to the point that you don’t even see some of your features!! Max’s headshots were fairly price for the amazing quality pictures I got!! Overall it was so much fun to walk around Northport village and getting pro pictures for auditions!! Thank you so so much definitely would recommend and I’m definitely going to get more headshots at another point!!
