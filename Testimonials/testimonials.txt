I highly recommend Max as a photographer! He is incredibly kind and professional, and his photos are wonderful! He struck the right balance between capturing candids and posed photos -- exactly what I wanted. I look forward to booking him for my events to come! 10/10

CRISTINA JUVIER
We were so lucky to find Max and his work with Julia’s headshots was fantastic. Amazing quality and value- and he captured so much of her personality and character. He is a pleasure to work with and I think this is a unique opportunity to work with a young, riding talent before he becomes so huge he is no longer affordable for the regular folks! Highly recommended. Thank you Max!

Max did a fantastic job taking pics of my staff as headshots. He brought lighting and a pro camera and an easy going attitude. The pics came out great. We already booked our next session!
MAX LAMBERG
He [Max] helped me out with poses and emotions and made me feel so comfortable with the pictures. I LOVED how the pictures came out and they were exactly how I imagined they’d be! I would absolutely recommend Max to anyone needing professional photos or even casual ones! I’m so grateful for him and his services , the money was well spent!

Max was very professional and knowledgeable. He was very helpful in recommending outfits and colors. The pictures came out beautiful. But more importantly he made my daughters feel comfortable and was able to capture their personalities.

I loved getting headshots by Max N Cheese photography!! I wanted headshots for other theater auditions because I didn’t have good photos of me to show. So headshots by Max was cheaper then getting a fancy professional that edits you to the point that you don’t even see some of your features!! Max’s headshots were fairly price for the amazing quality pictures I got!! Overall it was so much fun to walk around Northport village and getting pro pictures for auditions!! Thank you so so much definitely would recommend and I’m definitely going to get more headshots at another point!!
