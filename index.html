                            <br>Hey there, I'm Max! 
                            <br><br>About Me: I’m a 17 year old actor and photographer. I’ve been acting since I was 9 years old and taking pictures since I was 11. I’ve been in an off-broadway show, done voiceover work, participated in films and TV, and have been a part of local/regional theatre productions.
                            <br><br>How it began: I bought my first camera during the COVID pandemic and started to take pictures of nature. I realized that I loved taking these pictures and decided to begin to get involved in photography at my high school. There, after taking pictures for the theatre productions, I was asked if I took headshots. That is when I decided to start Max N Cheese Photography!
                            <br><br>My work: I have an inside point-of-view in headshots from my acting background and I also take pictures for families, productions, and events. Take a look at some of my work in my portfolio tab.
